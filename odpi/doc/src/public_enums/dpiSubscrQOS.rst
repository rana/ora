This enumeration identifies the quality of service flags for sending
notifications to subscriptions.

Value                        Description
===========================  ==================================================
DPI_SUBSCR_QOS_RELIABLE      Notifications are sent reliably. If the database
                             fails, the notifications are not lost. This is
                             not supported for nonpersistent queues or buffered
                             messaging.
DPI_SUBSCR_QOS_DEREG_NFY     When the notification has been received, the
                             subscription is removed.
DPI_SUBSCR_QOS_ROWIDS        Information on the rows affected by the database
                             or query change is sent along with the
                             notification.
DPI_SUBSCR_QOS_QUERY         Perform query notification instead of database
                             change notification. Notification is done in
                             guaranteed mode which guarantees that the query
                             has in fact changed.
DPI_SUBSCR_QOS_BEST_EFFORT   Perform query notification in best effort mode
                             which may result in notifications being sent when
                             the query has not in fact changed. This is needed
                             for complex queries that cannot be registered in
                             guaranteed mode.
