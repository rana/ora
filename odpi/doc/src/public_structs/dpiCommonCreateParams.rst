.. _dpiCommonCreateParams:

dpiCommonCreateParams
---------------------

This structure is used for creating session pools and standalone connections to
the database.  All members are initialized to default values using the
:func:`dpiContext_initCommonCreateParams()` function.

.. member:: dpiCreateMode dpiCommonCreateParams.createMode

    Specifies the mode used for creating connections. It is expected to be
    one or more of the values from the enumeration :ref:`dpiCreateMode`, OR'ed
    together. The default value is DPI_MODE_CREATE_DEFAULT.

.. member:: const char \* dpiCommonCreateParams.encoding

    Specifies the encoding to use for CHAR data, as a null-terminated ASCII
    string. Either an IANA or Oracle specific character set name is expected.
    NULL is also acceptable which implies the use of the NLS_LANG environment
    variable. The default value is NULL.

.. member:: const char \* dpiCommonCreateParams.nencoding

    Specifies the encoding to use for NCHAR data, as a null-terminated ASCII
    string. Either an IANA or Oracle specific character set name is expected.
    NULL is also acceptable which implies the use of the NLS_NCHAR environment
    variable. The default value is NULL.

.. member:: const char \* dpiCommonCreateParams.edition

    Specifies the edition to be used when creating a standalone connection. It
    is expected to be NULL (meaning that no edition is set) or a byte string in
    the encoding specified by the :member:`dpiCommonCreateParams.encoding`
    member. The default value is NULL.

.. member:: uint32_t dpiCommonCreateParams.editionLength

    Specifies the length of the :member:`dpiCommonCreateParams.edition` member,
    in bytes. The default value is 0.

.. member:: const char \* dpiCommonCreateParams.driverName

    Specifies the name of the driver that is being used. It is expected to be
    NULL or a byte string in the encoding specified by the
    :member:`dpiCommonCreateParams.encoding` member. The default value is NULL.

.. member:: uint32_t dpiCommonCreateParams.driverNameLength

    Specifies the length of the :member:`dpiCommonCreateParams.driverName`
    member, in bytes. The default value is 0.
