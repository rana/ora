.. _dpiObject:

dpiObject
---------

This structure represents instances of the types created by the SQL command
CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE and is available by handle to a calling application or
driver. The implementation for this type is found in dpiObject.c. An object is
created by calling the function :func:`dpiObjectType_createObject()` or by
calling the function :func:`dpiObject_copy()`. They are also created implicitly
by creating a variable of the type DPI_ORACLE_TYPE_OBJECT. Objects are
destroyed when the last reference is released by calling the function
:func:`dpiObject_release()`. All of the attributes of the structure
:ref:`dpiBaseType` are included in this structure in addition to the ones
specific to this structure described below.

.. member:: dpiObjectType \*dpiObject.type

    Specifies a pointer to the :ref:`dpiObjectType` structure which was used to
    create the object.

.. member:: dvoid \*dpiObject.instance

    Specifies a pointer to the object instance.

.. member:: dvoid \*dpiObject.indicator

    Specifies a pointer to the object indicator.

.. member:: int dpiObject.isIndependent

    Specifies whether the object is independent (1) or not (0). An object is
    independent if it was created directly, not indirectly by getting another
    object's attribute (where the child object remains part of the parent
    object's contents).
