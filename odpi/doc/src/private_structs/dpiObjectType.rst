.. _dpiObjectType:

dpiObjectType
-------------

This structure represents types such as those created by the SQL command CREATE
OR REPLACE TYPE and is available by handle to a calling application or driver.
The implementation for this type is found in dpiObjectType.c. Object types are
created by calling the function :func:`dpiConn_getObjectType()` or implicitly
when calling the function :func:`dpiStmt_getQueryInfo()` on a query column that
contains objects. They are also created implicitly by calling the function
:func:`dpiObjectAttr_getInfo()` on an attribute that contains objects or by
calling the function :func:`dpiObjectType_getInfo()` on a collection that
contains objects. Object types are destroyed when the last reference to them is
released by the call :func:`dpiObjectType_release()`. All of the attributes of
the structure :ref:`dpiBaseType` are included in this structure in addition to
the ones specific to this structure described below.

.. member:: dpiConn \*dpiObjectType.conn

    Specifies a pointer to the :ref:`dpiConn` structure which was used to
    create this structure.

.. member:: OCIType \*dpiObjectType.tdo

    Specifies the OCI TDO (type descriptor) handle.

.. member:: OCITypeCode dpiObjectType.typeCode

    Specifies the OCI type code.

.. member:: const char \*dpiObjectType.schema

    Specifies the schema of the type, as a byte string in the encoding used
    for CHAR data.

.. member:: uint32_t dpiObjectType.schemaLength

    Specifies the length of the :member:`dpiObjectType.schema` member, in
    bytes.

.. member:: const char \*dpiObjectType.name

    Specifies the name of the type, as a byte string in the encoding used for
    CHAR data.

.. member:: uint32_t dpiObjectType.nameLength

    Specifies the length of the :member:`dpiObjectType.name` member, in bytes.

.. member:: const dpiOracleType \*dpiObjectType.elementOracleType

    Specifies a pointer to the :ref:`dpiOracleType` structure which identifies
    the type of data stored in the elements of the collection. If this type
    does not refer to a collection, this value is NULL.

.. member:: dpiObjectType \*dpiObjectType.elementType

    Specifies a pointer to the :ref:`dpiObjectType` structure which identifies
    the type of object stored in elements of the collection. If this type does
    not refer to a collection, this value is NULL.

.. member:: boolean dpiObjectType.isCollection

    Specifies if the type refers to a collection (1) or not (0).

.. member:: uint16_t dpiObjectType.numAttributes

    Specifies how many attributes the type has.
