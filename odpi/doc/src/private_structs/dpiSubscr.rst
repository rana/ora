dpiSubscr
---------

This structure represents subscriptions to events such as continuous query
notification and object change notification and is available by handle to a
calling application or driver. The implementation for this type is found in
dpiSubscr.c. Subscriptions are created by calling the function
:func:`dpiConn_newSubscription()` and are destroyed by calling the function
:func:`dpiSubscr_close()` or by releasing the last reference when calling the
function :func:`dpiSubscr_release()`. All of the attributes of the structure
:ref:`dpiBaseType` are included in this structure in addition to the ones
