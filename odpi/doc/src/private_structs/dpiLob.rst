.. _dpiLob:

dpiLob
------

This structure represents large objects (CLOB, BLOB, NCLOB and BFILE) and is
available by handle to a calling application or driver. The implementation for
this type is found in dpiLob.c. A temporary LOB can be created by calling the
function :func:`dpiConn_newTempLob()` but generally LOBs are created implicitly
by creating a variable of type DPI_ORACLE_TYPE_CLOB, DPI_ORACLE_TYPE_NCLOB,
DPI_ORACLE_TYPE_BLOB or DPI_ORACLE_TYPE_BFILE is created. They are destroyed
when the last reference is released by calling the function
:func:`dpiLob_release()`. All of the attributes of the structure
:ref:`dpiBaseType` are included in this structure in addition to the ones
specific to this structure described below.

.. member:: dpiConn \*dpiLob.conn

    Specifies a pointer to the :ref:`dpiConn` structure which was used to
    create the LOB.

.. member:: const dpiOracleType \*dpiLob.type

    Specifies a pointer to a :ref:`dpiOracleType` structure which identifies
    the type of Oracle data that is being represented by this LOB.

.. member:: OCILobLocator \*dpiLob.locator

    Specifies the OCILobLocator handle.

.. member:: char \*dpiLob.buffer

    Specifies a buffer used for storing the directory alias name and file name
    of a BFILE type LOB, when that information is requested by means of calling
    the function :func:`dpiLob_getDirectoryAndFileName()`. In all other cases
    this value is NULL.
