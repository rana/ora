.. _dpiConn:

dpiConn
-------

This structure represents connections to the database and is available by
handle to a calling application or driver. The implementation for this type is
found in dpiConn.c. Connections are created by calling the function
:func:`dpiConn_create()` or acquired from a session pool by calling the
function :func:`dpiPool_acquireConnection()`. They can be closed by calling the
function :func:`dpiConn_close()` or releasing the last reference to the
connection by calling the function :func:`dpiConn_release()`. Connection
handles are used to create all handles other than session pools and context
handles. All of the attributes of the structure :ref:`dpiBaseType` are included
in this structure in addition to the ones specific to this structure described
below.

.. member:: dpiPool \*dpiConn.pool

    Specifies a pointer to a :ref:`dpiPool` structure if the connection was
    acquired from a pool; otherwise, the value is NULL.

.. member:: OCISvcCtx \*dpiConn.handle

    Specifies the OCI service context handle for the connection.

.. member:: OCIServer \*dpiConn.serverHandle

    Specifies the OCI server handle. This value is retrieved if it is not used
    during the creation of the connection and used to avoid excessive calls to
    OCIAttrGet().

.. member:: OCISession \*dpiConn.sessionHandle

    Specifies the OCI session handle. This value is retrieved if it is not used
    during the creation of the connection and used to avoid excessive calls to
    OCIAttrGet().

.. member:: const char \*dpiConn.releaseString

    Specifies a pointer to an array of bytes making up the release string, in
    the encoding used for CHAR data. The initial value is NULL and is cached
    upon the first call to the function :func:`dpiConn_getServerVersion()`.

.. member:: uint32_t dpiConn.releaseStringLength

    Specifies the length of the :member:`dpiConn.releaseString` member, in
    bytes. If the release string has not yet been retrieved, however, this
    value is 0.

.. member:: int dpiConn.versionNum

    Specifies the first part of the five part server version. The initial value
    is 0 and is cached upon the first call to the function
    :func:`dpiConn_getServerVersion()`.

.. member:: int dpiConn.releaseNum

    Specifies the second part of the five part server version. The initial
    value is 0 and is cached upon the first call to the function
    :func:`dpiConn_getServerVersion()`.

.. member:: int dpiConn.updateNum

    Specifies the third part of the five part server version. The initial value
    is 0 and is cached upon the first call to the function
    :func:`dpiConn_getServerVersion()`.

.. member:: int dpiConn.portReleaseNum

    Specifies the fourth part of the five part server version. The initial
    value is 0 and is cached upon the first call to the function
    :func:`dpiConn_getServerVersion()`.

.. member:: int dpiConn.portUpdateNum

    Specifies the last part of the five part server version. The initial value
    is 0 and is cached upon the first call to the function
    :func:`dpiConn_getServerVersion()`.

.. member:: uint32_t dpiConn.commitMode

    Specifies the mode to use when performing commits. This value is set to
    OCI_TRANS_TWOPHASE during two phase commits; otherwise, it is always set to
    the value OCI_DEFAULT.

.. member:: int dpiConn.externalHandle

    Specifies if the OCI service context handle found in the
    :member:`dpiConn.handle` member was acquired from an external source (1) or
    created by the library (0). If this value is 1, the connection will be left
    untouched when the structure is freed as it is assumed that the external
    source will manage the connection itself.

.. member:: int dpiConn.dropSession

    Specifies if the session should be dropped from the session pool due to an
    unrecoverable error (1) or not (0). This value is not used for standalone
    connections.

.. member:: int dpiConn.standalone

    Specifies if the connection is a standalone connection (1) or not (0).
