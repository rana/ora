Connection Functions
********************

Connection handles are used to represent connections to the database. These can
be standalone connections created by calling the function
:func:`dpiConn_create()` or acquired from a session pool by calling the
function :func:`dpiPool_acquireConnection()`. They can be closed by calling the
function :func:`dpiConn_close()` or releasing the last reference to the
connection by calling the function :func:`dpiConn_release()`. Connection
handles are used to create all handles other than session pools and context
handles.

.. function:: int dpiConn_addRef(dpiConn \*conn)

    Adds a reference to the connection. This is intended for situations where a
    reference to the connection needs to be maintained independently of the
    reference returned when the connection was created.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **conn** -- the connection to which a reference is to be added. If the
    reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.

    made up of the formatId, transactionId and branchId.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **conn** -- a reference to the connection which is to be a part of the
    distributed transaction. If the reference is NULL or invalid an error is
    returned.

.. function:: int dpiConn_setCurrentSchema(dpiConn \*conn, \
        const char \*value, uint32_t valueLength)

    Sets the current schema to be used on the connection. This has the same
    effect as the SQL statement ALTER SESSION SET CURRENT_SCHEMA. The value
    be changed when the next call requiring a round trip to the server is
    performed. If the new schema name does not exist, the same error is
    returned as when the alter session statement is executed. The new schema
