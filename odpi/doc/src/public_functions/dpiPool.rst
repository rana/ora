Pool Functions
**************

Pool handles are used to represent session pools. They are created using the
function :func:`dpiPool_create()` and can be closed by calling the function
:func:`dpiPool_close()` or releasing the last reference to the pool by
calling the function :func:`dpiPool_release()`. Pools can be used to create
connections by calling the function :func:`dpiPool_acquireConnection()`.


.. function:: int dpiPool_acquireConnection(dpiPool \*pool, \
        const char \*userName, uint32_t userNameLength, \
        const char \*password, uint32_t passwordLength, \
        dpiConnCreateParams \*params, dpiConn \**conn)

    Acquires a connection from the pool and returns a reference to it. This
    reference should be released as soon as it is no longer needed.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **pool** -- the pool from which a connection is to be acquired. If the
    reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.

    **userName** -- the name of the user used for authenticating the user, as
    a byte string in the encoding used for CHAR data. NULL is also acceptable
    if external authentication is being requested or credentials were supplied
    when the pool was created.

    **userNameLength** -- the length of the userName parameter, in bytes, or
    0 if the userName parameter is NULL.

    **password** -- the password to use for authenticating the user, as a byte
    string in the encoding used for CHAR data. NULL is also acceptable if
    external authentication is being requested or if credentials were supplied
    when the pool was created.

    **passwordLength** -- the length of the password parameter, in bytes, or
    0 if the password parameter is NULL.

    **params** -- a pointer to a :ref:`dpiConnCreateParams` structure which
    is used to specify parameters for connection creation. NULL is also
    acceptable in which case all default parameters will be used when creating
    the connection.

    **conn** -- a reference to the connection that is acquired from the pool.
    This value is populated upon successful completion of this function.


.. function:: int dpiPool_addRef(dpiPool \*pool)

    Adds a reference to the pool. This is intended for situations where a
    reference to the pool needs to be maintained independently of the reference
    returned when the pool was created.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **pool** -- the pool to which a reference is to be added. If the reference
    is NULL or invalid an error is returned.


.. function:: int dpiPool_close(dpiPool \*pool, dpiPoolCloseMode closeMode)

    Closes the pool and makes it unusable for further activity.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **pool** -- a reference to the pool which is to be closed. If the reference
    is NULL or invalid an error is returned.

    **closeMode** -- one or more of the values from the enumeration
    :ref:`dpiPoolCloseMode`, OR'ed together.


.. function:: int dpiPool_create(const dpiContext \*context, \
        const char \*userName, uint32_t userNameLength, \
        const char \*password, uint32_t passwordLength, \
        const char \*connectString, uint32_t connectStringLength, \
        dpiCommonCreateParams \*commonParams, \
        dpiPoolCreateParams \*createParams, dpiPool \**pool)

    Creates a session pool which creates and maintains a group of stateless
    sessions to the database. The main benefit of session pooling is
    performance since making a connection to the database is a time-consuming
    activity, especially when the database is remote.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.
    If a failure occurs, the errorInfo structure is filled in with error
    information.

    **context** -- the context handle created earlier using the function
    :func:`dpiContext_create()`. If the handle is NULL or invalid an error is
    returned.

    **userName** -- the name of the user used for authenticating sessions, as
    a byte string in the encoding used for CHAR data. NULL is also acceptable
    if external authentication is being requested or if a heterogeneous pool is
    being created.

    **userNameLength** -- the length of the userName parameter, in bytes, or
    0 if the userName parameter is NULL.

    **password** -- the password to use for authenticating sessions, as a byte
    string in the encoding used for CHAR data. NULL is also acceptable if
    external authentication is being requested or if a heterogeneous pool is
    being created.

    **passwordLength** -- the length of the password parameter, in bytes, or
    0 if the password parameter is NULL.

    **connectString** -- the connect string identifying the database to which
    connections are to be established by the session pool, as a byte string
    in the encoding used for CHAR data. NULL is also acceptable for local
    connections (identified by the environment variable ORACLE_SID).

    **connectStringLength** -- the length of the connectString parameter, in
    bytes, or 0 if the connectString parameter is NULL.

    **commonParams** -- a pointer to a :ref:`dpiCommonCreateParams` structure
    which is used to specify context parameters for pool creation. NULL is also
    acceptable in which case all default parameters will be used when creating
    the pool.

    **createParams** -- a pointer to a :ref:`dpiPoolCreateParams` structure
    which is used to specify parameters for pool creation. NULL is also
    acceptable in which case all default parameters will be used for pool
    creation.

    **pool** -- a reference to the pool that is created. This value will be
    NULL if the creation of the pool structure was completely unsuccessful but
    otherwise will contain a valid handle, even if an error is returned. If a
    value is returned, a call to :func:`dpiPool_release()` must be made in
    order to release the reference.

    **errorInfo** -- a pointer to a :ref:`dpiErrorInfo` structure which will be
    populated with error information if an error takes place during the
    execution of this function. If no error takes place, the structure is not
    modified in any way.


.. function:: int dpiPool_getBusyCount(dpiPool \*pool, uint32_t \*value)

    Returns the number of sessions in the pool that are busy.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **pool** -- a reference to the pool from which the number of busy sessions
    is to be retrieved. If the reference is NULL or invalid an error is
    returned.

    **value** -- a pointer to the value which will be populated upon successful
    completion of this function.


.. function:: int dpiPool_getEncodingInfo(dpiPool \*pool, \
        dpiEncodingInfo \*info)

    Returns the encoding information used by the pool. This will be equivalent
    to the values passed when the pool was created, or the values retrieved
    from the environment variables NLS_LANG and NLS_NCHAR.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **pool** -- a reference to the pool whose encoding information is to
    be retrieved. If the reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.

    **info** -- a pointer to a :ref:`dpiEncodingInfo` structure which will be
    populated with the encoding information used by the pool.


.. function:: int dpiPool_getGetMode(dpiPool \*pool, dpiPoolGetMode \*value)

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **pool** -- a reference to the pool from which the mode used for
    acquiring connections is to be retrieved. If the reference is NULL or
    invalid an error is returned.

.. function:: int dpiPool_getMaxLifetimeSession(dpiPool \*pool, \
        uint32_t \*value)

    only when another session is released back to the pool.

.. function:: int dpiPool_release(dpiPool \*pool)

    Releases a reference to the pool. A count of the references to the pool is
    maintained and when this count reaches zero, the memory associated with the
    pool is freed and the session pool is closed if that has not already
    taken place using the function :func:`dpiPool_close()`.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.
