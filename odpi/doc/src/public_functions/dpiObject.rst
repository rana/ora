Object Functions
****************

Object handles are used to represent instances of the types created by the SQL
command CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE. They are created by calling the function
:func:`dpiObjectType_createObject()` or calling the function
:func:`dpiObject_copy()` or implicitly by creating a variable of the type
DPI_ORACLE_TYPE_OBJECT. The are destroyed when the last reference is released
by calling the function :func:`dpiObject_release()`.

.. function:: int dpiObject_addRef(dpiObject \*obj)

    Adds a reference to the object. This is intended for situations where a
    reference to the object needs to be maintained independently of the
    reference returned when the object was created.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **obj** -- the object to which a reference is to be added. If the reference
    is NULL or invalid an error is returned.


.. function:: int dpiObject_appendElement(dpiObject \*obj, \
        dpiNativeTypeNum nativeTypeNum, dpiData \*value)

    Sets the value of the element found at the specified index.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **obj** -- the object to which the value is to be appended. If the
    reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned. Likewise, if the object
    does not refer to a collection an error is returned.

    **nativeTypeNum** -- the native type of the data that is to be appended. It
    should be one of the values from the enumeration :ref:`dpiNativeTypeNum`.

    **value** -- a pointer to a :ref:`dpiData` structure which contains the
    value of the element to append to the collection.


.. function:: int dpiObject_copy(dpiObject \*obj, dpiObject \**copiedObj)

    Creates an independent copy of an object and returns a reference to the
    newly created object. This reference should be released as soon as it is
    no longer needed.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **obj** -- the object which is to be copied. If the reference is NULL or
    invalid an error is returned.

    **copiedObj** -- a pointer to a reference to the object which is created as
    a copy of the first object, which is populated upon successful completion
    of this function.


.. function:: int dpiObject_deleteElementByIndex(dpiObject \*obj, \
        int32_t index)

    Deletes an element from the collection. Note that the position ordinals of
    the remaining elements are not changed. The delete operation creates
    *holes* in the collection.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **obj** -- the object from which the element is to be deleted. If the
    reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned. Likewise, if the object
    does not refer to a collection an error is returned.

    **index** -- the index of the element that is to be deleted. If no element
    exists at that index an error is returned.

        dpiObjectAttr \*attr, dpiNativeTypeNum nativeTypeNum, dpiData \*value)

    Returns the value of one of the object's attributes.

    **obj** -- the object from which the attribute is to be retrieved. If the
    reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.

    **attr** -- the attribute which is to be retrieved. The attribute must
    belong to the same type as the object; otherwise, an error is returned.

    **nativeTypeNum** -- the native type of the data that is to be retrieved.
    It should be one of the values from the enumeration
    :ref:`dpiNativeTypeNum`.

    **value** -- a pointer to a :ref:`dpiData` structure which will be
    populated with the value of the attribute when this function completes
    successfully.

    the reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned. Likewise, if the
    object does not refer to a collection an error is returned.

    **index** -- the index into the collection that is to be checked.

    at the specified index (1) or not (0), which will be populated when this
    function completes successfully.
