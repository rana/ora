*******************
Statement Functions
*******************

Statement handles are used to represent statements of all types (queries, DML,
DDL and PL/SQL). They are created by calling the function
:func:`dpiConn_prepareStmt()` or the function :func:`dpiSubscr_prepareStmt()`.
They are also created implicitly when a variable of type DPI_ORACLE_TYPE_STMT
is created. Statement handles can be closed by calling the function
:func:`dpiStmt_close()` or by releasing the last reference to the statement by
calling the function :func:`dpiStmt_release()`.

.. function:: int dpiStmt_addRef(dpiStmt \*stmt)

    Adds a reference to the statement. This is intended for situations where a
    reference to the statement needs to be maintained independently of the
    reference returned when the statement was created.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **stmt** -- the statement to which a reference is to be added. If the
    reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.


.. function:: int dpiStmt_bindByName(dpiStmt \*stmt, const char \*name, \
        uint32_t nameLength, dpiVar \*var)

    Binds a variable to a named placeholder in the statement. A reference to
    the variable is retained by the library and is released when the statement
    itself is released or a new variable is bound to the same name.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **stmt** -- a reference to the statement which is to have the variable
    bound. If the reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.

    **name** -- a byte string in the encoding used for CHAR data giving the
    name of the placeholder which is to be bound.

    **nameLength** -- the length of the name parameter, in bytes.

    **var** -- a reference to the variable which is to be bound. If the
    reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.


.. function:: int dpiStmt_bindByPos(dpiStmt \*stmt, uint32_t pos, dpiVar \*var)

    Binds a variable to a placeholder in the statement by position. A reference
    to the variable is retained by the library and is released when the
    statement itself is released or a new variable is bound to the same
    position.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **stmt** -- a reference to the statement which is to have the variable
    bound. If the reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.

    **pos** -- the position which is to be bound. The position of a placeholder
    is determined by its location in the statement. Placeholders are numbered
    from left to right, starting from 1, and duplicate names do not count as
    additional placeholders.

    **var** -- a reference to the variable which is to be bound. If the
    reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.


.. function:: int dpiStmt_bindValueByName(dpiStmt \*stmt, const char \*name, \
        uint32_t nameLength, dpiNativeTypeNum nativeTypeNum, dpiData \*data)

    Binds a value to a named placeholder in the statement without the need to
    create a variable directly. One is created implicitly and released when the
    statement is released or a new value is bound to the same name.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **stmt** -- a reference to the statement which is to have the variable
    bound. If the reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.

    **name** -- a byte string in the encoding used for CHAR data giving the
    name of the placeholder which is to be bound.

    **nameLength** -- the length of the name parameter, in bytes.

    **nativeTypeNum** -- the type of data that is being bound. It is expected
    to be one of the values from the enumeration :ref:`dpiNativeTypeNum`.

    **data** -- the data which is to be bound, as a pointer to a
    :ref:`dpiData` structure. A variable will be created based on the type of
    data being bound and a reference to this variable retained. Once the
    statement has been executed, this new variable will be released.


.. function:: int dpiStmt_bindValueByPos(dpiStmt \*stmt, uint32_t pos, \
        dpiNativeTypeNum nativeTypeNum, dpiData \*data)

    Binds a value to a placeholder in the statement without the need to create
    a variable directly. One is created implicitly and released when the
    statement is released or a new value is bound to the same position.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **stmt** -- a reference to the statement which is to have the variable
    bound. If the reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.

    **pos** -- the position which is to be bound. The position of a placeholder
    is determined by its location in the statement. Placeholders are numbered
    from left to right, starting from 1, and duplicate names do not count as
    additional placeholders.

    **nativeTypeNum** -- the type of data that is being bound. It is expected
    to be one of the values from the enumeration :ref:`dpiNativeTypeNum`.

    **data** -- the data which is to be bound, as a pointer to a
    :ref:`dpiData` structure. A variable will be created based on the type of
    data being bound and a reference to this variable retained. Once the
    statement has been executed, this new variable will be released.


.. function:: int dpiStmt_close(dpiStmt \*stmt, const char \*tag, \
        uint32_t tagLength)

    Closes the statement and makes it unusable for further work immediately,
    rather than when the reference count reaches zero.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **stmt** -- a reference to the statement which is to be closed. If the
    reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.

    **tag** -- a key to associate the statement with in the statement cache,
    in the encoding used for CHAR data. NULL is also acceptable in which case
    the statement is not tagged. This value is ignored for statements that are
    acquired through bind variables (REF CURSOR) or implicit results.

    **tagLength** -- the length of the tag parameter, in bytes, or 0 if the
    tag parameter is NULL.


.. function:: int dpiStmt_define(dpiStmt \*stmt, uint32_t pos, dpiVar \*var)

    Defines the variable that will be used to fetch rows from the statement. A
    reference to the variable will be retained until the next define is
    performed on the same position or the statement is closed.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **stmt** -- a reference to the statement on which the variable is to be
    defined. If the reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned. Note

        dpiOracleTypeNum oracleTypeNum, dpiNativeTypeNum nativeTypeNum, \
        uint32_t size, int sizeIsBytes, dpiObjectType \*objType)

    Defines the type of data that will be used to fetch rows from the
    statement. This is intended for use with the function
    :func:`dpiStmt_getQueryValue()`, when the default data type derived from
    the column metadata needs to be overridden by the application. Internally,
    a variable is created with the specified data type and size.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **stmt** -- a reference to the statement on which the define is to take
    place.  If the reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned. Note
    that the statement must have already been executed or an error is returned.

    **pos** -- the position which is to be defined. The first position is 1.

    **oracleTypeNum** -- the type of Oracle data that is to be used. It should
    be one of the values from the enumeration :ref:`dpiOracleTypeNum`.

    **nativeTypeNum** -- the type of native C data that is to be used. It
    should be one of the values from the enumeration :ref:`dpiNativeTypeNum`.

    **size** -- the maximum size of the buffer used for transferring data
    to/from Oracle. This value is only used for variables transferred as byte
    strings. Size is either in characters or bytes depending on the value of
    the sizeIsBytes parameter. If the value is in characters, internally the
    value will be multipled by the maximum number of bytes for each character
    and that value used instead when determining the necessary buffer size.

    **sizeIsBytes** -- boolean value indicating if the size parameter
    refers to characters or bytes. This flag is only used if the variable
    refers to character data.

    **objType** -- a reference to the object type of the object that is being
    bound or fetched. This value is only used if the Oracle type is
    DPI_ORACLE_TYPE_OBJECT.


.. function:: int dpiStmt_execute(dpiStmt \*stmt, dpiExecMode mode, \
        uint32_t \*numQueryColumns)

    Executes the statement using the bound values. For queries this makes
    available metadata which can be acquired using the function
    :func:`dpiStmt_getQueryInfo()`. For non-queries, out and in-out variables
    are populated with their values.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **stmt** -- a reference to the statement which is to be executed. If the
    reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.

    **mode** -- one or more of the values from the enumeration
    :ref:`dpiExecMode`, OR'ed together.

    **numQueryColumns** -- a pointer to the number of columns which are being
    queried, which will be populated upon successful execution of the
    statement. If the statement does not refer to a query, the value is set to
    0.


.. function:: int dpiStmt_executeMany(dpiStmt \*stmt, dpiExecMode mode, \
        uint32_t numIters)

    successful completion of the function.


.. function:: int dpiStmt_release(dpiStmt \*stmt)

    Releases a reference to the statement. A count of the references to the
    statement is maintained and when this count reaches zero, the memory
    associated with the statement is freed and the statement is closed if that
    has not already taken place using the function :func:`dpiStmt_close()`.

    fetching must have this many (or more) elements allocated for them. The
    higher this value is the less network round trips are required to fetch
    rows from the database but more memory is also required. A value of zero
    will reset the array size to the default value of
