# ODPI-C version 2.0.0-beta.4

Oracle Database Programming Interface for C (ODPI-C) is an open source

- Numeric datatypes (NUMBER, BINARY_FLOAT, BINARY_DOUBLE)
- Dates, Timestamps, Intervals
- Binary types (BLOB, BFILE, RAW, LONG RAW)
- PL/SQL datatypes (PLS_INTEGER, BOOLEAN, Collections, Records)
- JSON
- User Defined Types
- REF CURSOR, Nested cursors, Implicit Result Sets
- Array fetch
- Array bind/execute
- Session pools (homogeneous and non-homogeneous with proxy authentication)
- Standalone connections
- Database Resident Connection Pooling (DRCP)
- External authentication
- Statement caching (tagging)
- End-to-end tracing, mid-tier authentication and auditing (action, module,
  client identifier, client info, database operation)
- Edition Based Redefinition
- Scrollable cursors
- DML RETURNING
- Privileged connection support (SYSDBA, SYSOPER, SYSASM, PRELIM_AUTH)
- Database Startup/Shutdown
- Session Tagging

## Install

A sample Makefile is provided if you wish to build ODPI-C as a shared
library. Otherwise, include the ODPI-C source code in your project.  ODPI-C
uses the shared library loading mechanism available on each supported platform
to load the Oracle Client library at runtime. This allows code using ODPI-C to
be built only once, and then run using Oracle Client 11.2, 12.1 or 12.2
libraries. See
[Installation](https://oracle.github.io/odpi/doc/installation.html)
for more information.

Oracle client libraries are available in the free
[Oracle Instant Client](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index.html).
The "Basic" or "Basic Light" package is required at runtime.  Client libraries
are also available in any Oracle Database installation or full Oracle Client
installation.

ODPI-C has been tested on Linux, Windows and macOS.  Other platforms should
also work but have not been tested.  On Windows, Visual Studio 2008 or higher
is required.  On macOS, Xcode 6 or higher is required.  On Linux, GCC 4.4 or
higher is required.
